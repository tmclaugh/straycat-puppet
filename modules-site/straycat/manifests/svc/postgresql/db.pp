# == Define: straycat::svc::postgresql::db
#
# Create a DB on a pgsql host
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*db_user*]
#   Owner of database.
#   Type: string
#
# [*db_passwd*]
#   Password for database
#   Type: string
#
# [*db_name*]
#   Name of database; typically $name
#   Type: string
#
# [*auth_method*]
#   Auth method for owner.
#   Type: string
#
# [*address*]
#   Address oner access rule should be valid for
#   Type: string
#
# === Examples
#
# straycat::svc::postgresql::db { 'supercoolapp':
#   db_user   => 'supercool',
#   db_passwd => 'MyPasswordForThisDB'
# }
#
# === BUGS
#
# * We have no good way of having a DB on the pgsql host being realized in
#   time for an app on another host to work.  Right now just adding
#   resources directly to pgsql role class but still need to make sure
#   Puppet has run on there before new app host has been started up.
#
# * Authn/authz could be more robust.
