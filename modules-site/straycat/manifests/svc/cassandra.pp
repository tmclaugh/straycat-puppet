# == Class: straycat::svc::cassandra
#
# Setup a Cassandra DB node
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*cluster_name*]
#   Name of Cassandra cluser.
#   Type: string
#
# [*cassandra_package_name*]
#   DataStax Community Edition package name.  The name includes a version
#   which must correspond with the value of $cassandra_version.
#   Type: string
#
# [*cassandra_seeds*]
#   Array of IPs that are cluster seeds.
#   NOTE: This must be IPs, not hostnames.
#   Type: array
#
# [*cassandra_version*]
#   Package version to install.  Must correspond with the value of
#   $cassandra_package_name.
#   Type: string
#
# === Examples
#
# class { 'straycat::svc::cassandra':
#   cluster_name => 'myCluster'
# }
#
# === TODO
#
# * Figure out how to do overrides for cluster name and seeds.  Hiera? ENC?
#   both?
#
# * Come up with a better way of handling multi interface hosts.  This
#   is an issue with Vagrant clusters which communicate over eth1.  Right
#   now using a cluster name in Hiera to handle this.
#
# * Add monitoring and metrics reporting.
#
# === FIXME:
#
# * Cassandra wants Oracle Java but we only have OpenJDK.  With a mirror in
#   place we'd be able to provide that package.
